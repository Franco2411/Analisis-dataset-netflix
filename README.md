# Analisis-dataset-netflix
Data Analysis Project on the Netflix Dataset
## Description
In this project, I conducted a superficial analysis on a Netflix dataset downloaded from Kaggle to reinforce the knowledge acquired in Data Analysis.
To carry out this project, I used the following libraries:
* Pandas.
* NumPy.
* Matplotlib.
* Seaborn.
* SciPy.
  
Initially, the project involved data cleaning with the removal of null values. Then, various questions were answered using graphs and basic statistics.
